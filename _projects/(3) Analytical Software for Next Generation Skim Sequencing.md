description: While DNA sequencing is an integral part of genetics research, there is a significant lack of fully-functional tools that provide easy access to DNA sequencing in a cost-effective manner. Our goal is to minimize the inefficiencies faced by professionals who conduct NGS for Chloroplast, Mitochondria and plant ITS regions by developing a complete solution that incorporates existing DNA sequencing pipelines into a single environment that is both intuitive and accessible.
