Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
Am a Sri Lankan engineer and data science researcher who’s passionate about using technology to create meaningful impact. I enjoy exploring computer engineering concepts and turning them into solutions for real-world challenges, especially where they intersect with people, communities, and long-term change. I believe in steady, thoughtful work that drives sustainable success, and I approach problems with both a planner’s mindset and a curiosity for learning. Humor and creativity keep me grounded, but when it comes to work, I’m deeply committed and focused.
