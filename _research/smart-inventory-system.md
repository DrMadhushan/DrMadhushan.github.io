Developed a smart inventory management system and designed an interactive KIOSK app called MakerMate.

Maker Mate enables the lab users to apply for the project/ experiment requirements online and collect tools and equipment accordingly from a pickup locker while the lab admin can manage the entire inventory online with ease. Maker Mate can take similar role but for different use case on demand.
