#### Problems we faced
You can never do a reasonably complex project without any problem. Unexpected problems araise even in simple projects. I believe those problems are the key to learn and explore out-of-the-box things during a project. As I mentioned above, I barely messed up with github commits and pushes and lost a huge amount of work done in two days. I had a bad experience with my old laptop and it's OS crashed during the evatuation. The unlucky part is i didn't pushed a set of recent commits to the remote repo. Thats it... Its all gone. I couldn't recover any of them. So what next? I restarted the application design and development from the scratch again but this time with more care about proper source control. I can sense that you are thinking that I could have only reprogram the recent updates and complete the work. Thats true, but by then the evaluation is over and I had enough time to redo. So I focused more on enhancing the user experience and some useful extra functionalities adn rebuilt the console application.
